# FADING SHADOW

你在追寻何物？  

when the sky is falling.  
when the void crashing.  
when the reality breaks.    
when ... you realize you can did it.  

that time ...  
even the deepest shadow will fading away...

in the Minecraft codebase. These names are covered by a specific license. All modders should be aware of this
license. For the latest license text, refer to the mapping file itself, or the reference copy here:
